## Description

This is my second project in the Udacity front-end web developer course. This project is all about manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript. We were tasked with creating a landing page, and I have chosen to create a non-fungible token (NFT) project showcase for my landing page.

Instead of using the Udacity starter project, I generated my own static landing page project. I needed the HTML and CSS practice and wanted to create something that I could show to potential employers. I then converted my project from a static project to an interactive one using JavaScript and accompanying CSS styles.

## Content

The landing page showcases NFT projects that I have ownership in. I own the rights to use all of the images on the landing page since I own all the underlying NFTs. These are NFT projects that I believe in. I am also a member of these NFT projects' communities, which are mostly hosted on Discord.

## Usage

As per the requirements in the Udacity development strategy and project rubric documents, my landing page includes the following features:

- **Dynamically created navigation bar**
  - The navigation bar (right below the landing page title) is generated automatically from the landing page's static HTML sections using JavaScript.
- **Section highlights**
  - Each section, i.e. each NFT project, is highlighted when it is scrolled into view. The section title is highlighted (background changes) and the NFT image is highlighted (image saturation is bumped up).
- **Smooth scrolling**
  - A smooth scrolling action has been added when clicking on any navigation bar item.
- **Navigation item highlights**
  - The navigation bar item is highlighted (the background changes and the border becomes thicker) when its related section is scrolled into view.
- **Navigation bar is sticky and only visible when scrolling**
  - The navigation bar is sticky, i.e. it remains visible on the screen while scrolling. It is also only visible while scrolling, which allows for more website content to be visible when reading.
- **Responsive layout**
  - The landing page is customised for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. It will increase or decrease the amount of NFT projects per row automatically, based on the size of the display. The navigation bar is also fully responsive and shrinks, grows, or restructures itself based on the device's screen size.

## Special features

I've included a "dark mode" icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen. Click it and see how the website's theme transforms from light to dark.

## Browser compatibility

This website was tested and should work fine with the following web browsers:

- Chrome
- Brave Browser
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge
- Chrome Android
- Brave Browser Android

**Internet Explorer is <u>not</u> supported since it is a legacy browser and is not compatible with many new CSS styles.**

## Development

The entire website was developed using the Visual Studio Code code editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/). And the responsive design of the website was tested using Google Chrome DevTools' Device Mode (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/). This should help ensure the site displays correctly on various device sizes, including mobile phones, tablets, and computer monitors.

The following JavaScript standards were adhered to while developing this project:

- **JavaScript version:** ES2015/ES6
- **JavaScript standard:** ESLint (https://eslint.org/)
- **JavaScript documentation comments:** JSDoc3 (https://jsdoc.app/)

The following HTML, CSS, and JavaScript style guide was used:
