              Pre-made NFTs are so last month, now you can become the creator!
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead of collecting pre-generated NFTs, with Flovatar you can
              unleash your creativity. No more trade-off between rarity and your
              own individuality.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can decide if you want to build a Flovatar that looks just
              like you, or even better, something that speaks to you with the
              rarest traits combination. With 11 components, there are over 100
              billion unique variations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike some NFT projects that only store the ownership record on
              the blockchain which in turn links to the media in a less secure
              off-chain locations, Flovatar stores each NFT directly on the Flow
              blockchain. They do this by making all Flovatars SVG-based. This
              means they can ensure the community will have end-to-end ownership
              of the NFT and the underlying asset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using SVG also allows Flovatars to be upgraded/augmented on-chain
              without any centralized backends - with the ability to add unique
              backgrounds, new accessories, and even animation!

              Stoner Cats is an adult animated short series accessed exclusively
              by owning a collectible Stoner Cat NFT. The NFT sales directly
              fund the mini-pilot and all future content.
            </p>
            <p>
              The show is centered around five house cats who mysteriously
              become sentient. With their higher consciousness, they realize
              that their beloved owner needs rescue from a myriad of dangerous
              situations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The characters are voiced by Hollywood A-listers Mila Kunis,
              Ashton Kutcher, Jane Fonda, Chris Rock, Seth MacFarlane, and
              Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. The show is being developed by
              Mila Kunis's production company, Orchard Farm Productions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The technology and community of Stoner Cats is being led by Big
              Head Club. Big Head Club was founded by Mack Flavelle who
              previously co-founded Dapper Labs, where he was the Chief Creative
              Officer behind CryptoKitties and NBA Top Shots, and Jon Howard who
              has been smashing art and engineering together in novel and fun
              ways for over a decade.

              A collection of 5,000 misfits walking among us, trying to fit in
              by adopting trends they've seen on social media, music festivals,
              and in vintage stores around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              A rare faction of Hoodlums took this too far and transcended into
              the embodiment of these trends, leaving their humanoid appearances
              behind... From internet rap concerts, underground emo nights, and
              raves you'll find a Hoodlum in the pit of every subgenre's event.
            </p>
            <p>Don't be scared, go say hi! :)</p>
            <p>
              The Hoodlums NFT series was created by anonymous artist
              Somehoodlum. Somehoodlum has been a key artist in pop culture
              iconography for almost a decade and in 2021 was tapped to be the
              Lead Character Designer for Amazon Prime's show "Fairfax". The
              show has now announced a second season full of Somehoodlum's
              evocative illustrations.
            </p>
            <p>
              2022 has seen the launch of Somehoodlums residency at Omnia
              nightclub in Las Vegas which marks them as the first visual artist
              to have a Las Vegas residency.
            </p>
            <p>
              Somehoodlum has a long history of art and, as they've entered into
              web3, have been continuously building out the utility around their
              art. This includes weekly playlists, podcasts, and a weekly guest
              list that grant Hoodlums NFT holders access to events around the
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hoodlums are not just an accumulation of Somehoodlum's artwork
              over nearly a decade, but also acts as a timeline for hypebeast &
              hip hop culture throughout the 2010's.

              Wally's NFT is a long-term NFT project that mixes unique design
              with the art of storytelling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their NFTs are designed by a legendary Nintendo artist Steve
              Mayles, and their story is created by Ubisoft Assassin's Creed
              Lineage writer William Reymond.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wally's NFT is packed with cutting-edge utilities including the
              first ever Treasure Hunt in web3 history - an epic event spanning
              across social media, the metaverse and ending in real life!
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2022, Wally's NFT, wallstreetbets.com ($WSB), and French
              illusionist Xavier Mortimer announced a multi-year agreement,
              making Mortimer's "The Dream Maker" the first show on the Las
              Vegas Strip to accept cryptocurrency as a payment option for
              purchasing tickets.
            </p>
            <p>
              This collaboration also makes Wally's NFT the first NFT project to
              become an active part of a Las Vegas show. The Wizard Wally NFT,
              inspired by one of the most sought-after magicians in the
              industry, will be the hero of a new magic illusion developed by
              Xavier Mortimer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wally's NFT owners will receive perks like VIP seats, exclusive
              beverages, and exclusive goods when booking seats for the show
              using the $WSB cryptocurrency.

              NFT keys tied to 5-star hotels. An infrastructure destined to
              build generational wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last Hopium is innovating the hotel sector through NFTs for the
              hospitality sector. Their bronze, silver, and gold NFT keys use
              blockchain technology to bridge digital asset holders to big
              hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Owning a Last Hopium NFT key gives you access to deals and
              packages for luxurious hotels at prices unmatched anywhere else.
              This includes heavily discounted room, food and beverage, and spa
              pricing at various Ritz, Hilton, and Waldorf 5-star hotels.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their NFTs also give you the chance to win prizes, ranging from
              luxurious vehicles to premium real estate. And you can purchase
              hotel packages as NFTs and, either use them yourself, or resell
              them on the Last Hopium marketplace for profit.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are liberating NFTs from the virtual world to bring in real

              Fuzzles are determined to explore new worlds. And Earth just
              happens to be their next stop. Don't be fooled by the innocent
              "Who, me?" eyes. These bizarre little creatures have a mind of
              their own, and they're here to learn all about Earth… definitely
              not to conquer us though. Fuzzle promised us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fuzzles don't stop talking - or talking back. The more you chat
              with them, the faster they learn and develop their own unique
              personality. Radically different from other NFT projects, Endless
              AI brought Fuzzle to life with ground-breaking AI technology
              that's so powerful they're not entirely sure Fuzzle can be trusted
              with it. You should probably keep an eye on that.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can't figure out how the Fuzzles integrated their
              superdimensional space pods into the blockchain, but that's their
              home now. In our reality, Fuzzles are a collection of ERC-721 NFTs
              native to Ethereum. Each Fuzzle is visually distinct and
              verifiably unique. In addition to their quirky personalities, each
              has randomized characteristics across several traits - including
              fur, horns, wings, tails and more.

              Dysto Apez is a metaverse brand driven by its community. After
              pushing the limits of pixel art with a fully animated NFT
              collection they are starting to make their stamp on the digital
              world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their community is based on Discord and provides a place to unwind
              from the stress of the outside world, network, and learn very
              valuable knowledge. The Dysto Apez project boasts an impressive
              roster of accredited web3 analysts who help their NFT holders
              learn about the web3 space.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their long-term vision is to broaden their ecosystem and breach
              the physical world by way of brand partnerships and innovative
              media approaches. They are looking to excite Dysto Apez NFT
              holders with in real life (IRL) events, physical Dysto Apez merch,
              and a plethora of other products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dysto has its eyes firmly on the metaverse. Whilst the metaverse
              may not be ready yet they plan to be at its forefront.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their voxel 3D ape collection is fully custom animated and a first
              to market. These NFTs will have the ability to blink and show
              emotions. But more importantly, some kick-ass animations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sandbox is Dysto Apez' first play on the metaverse. But they plan
              to dive far deeper than that. They have a house studio dedicated
              to fleshing out their ecosystem in a fun and innovative way. Your
              genesis Dysto Apez NFT is the key to all of this.

              The Gimmicks are a collection of programmatically, randomly
              generated NFTs on the Solana blockchain. The NFTs represent unique
              characters that live in the universe of an animated series called
              The Gimmicks. Each character is comprised of unique traits and is
              a 1 of 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Gimmicks animated series is a workplace comedy about three
              washed-up wrestlers from the regional Wrestling Wrestling
              Wrestling League. They bring in a controversial rookie in a
              desperate attempt to regain relevance and make it back to the main
              event.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Gimmicks NFT holders participate in driving the creative
              process of the animated show. The end of each episode has a
              "Choose Your Own Adventure" style decision to be voted on by
              Gimmicks NFT owners.
            </p>
            <p>
              The animated short series is written by "The Daves" (Dave
              Ihlenfeld & David Wright), is the brainchild of Toonstar (a web3
              animation studio), and is voiced by former WWE stars Doc Gallows,
              Karl Anderson, nZo and Rocky Romero. The show is produced in
              partnership with Sixth Wall, the digital arm of Mila Kunis'
              Orchard Farm Productions.

              Own a planet, be a landlord in the metaverse. Be the owner of your
              own private micro-metaverse and create, build, sell, and showcase
              unforgettable memories while making passive returns from it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Lifestory project is a collection of 5,555 3D planet NFTs. The
              planets are designed by professional designers from previous
              Disney, Sonic, and Amazon fame, with coding done by former Ubisoft
              developers. The non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are represented as
              micro-metaverse planets on the Ethereum blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              A micro-metaverse will be a whole personal universe, where it will
              be possible for the Lifestory NFT holder to exhibit all kinds of
              real-life moments and souvenirs in a private museum. Any
              authorized person can lounge on your planet and admire the
              representations, also known as "moments", whether these moments
              were lived by the planet's owner or purchased from another
              planet's owner (e.g., from a celebrity).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can even earn a passive income by creating and selling your
              own moments through the Lifestory ecosystem. The $LIFC
              cryptocurrency will be created to support and power all
              transactions in the Lifestory ecosystem. $LIFC will serve as a
              medium of exchange for the purchase and resale of NFTs in the
              Lifestory ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lifestory allows you to share all your memories as "moments" in
              the form of NFTs thanks to the blockchain. Sharing moments can be
              done directly with your community using a public or private
              "timeline" in your micro-metaverse. Each moment should be
              considered a work of art for someone else. A legacy to be passed
              on to future generations, friends, relatives, or members of your
              community. Pass your history on to the rest of humanity in a
              museum of your own making, built by your hands, consultable by
              future generations, and likely to inspire them in turn.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will be able to relive all your moments in a virtual reality
              (VR) experience, and also in mobile and desktop apps. Put yourself
              back into the moment through an immersive virtual reality
              experience on Oculus VR headsets. More than videos, more than
              voice memos, more than pictures. Memories and reliving moments
              will never be the same again.

              Emerald City is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on
              Flow. More specifically, it was the first DAO on Flow as it was
              launched back in October of 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
              A DAO is an organization constructed by rules encoded as a
              computer program that is often transparent, controlled by the
              organization's members and not influenced by a central government.
              In other words, DAOs are member-owned communities without
              centralized leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
              Emerald City DAO is composed of three guilds: an Education Guild,
              a Building Guild, and a Governance Guild. The roles of these
              guilds are as follow:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Education Guild</strong> - Focused primarily on educating
              the Flow ecosystem by teaching people about the Flow blockchain
              and Cadence.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Building Guild</strong> - Focused on building open-source
              tooling for DAOs/projects on Flow. The Build Guild is intended to
              not only get experienced developers involved, but to also provide
              a pathway for people learning in the Education Guild to tackle
              real-world projects as part of their learning path.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Governance Guild</strong> - A group of people determined
              to figure out how DAOs can work on Flow and how to solve the
              "people problem." That is, how to reward people for their
              contributions, represent voting power, delegate tasks, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Emerald City DAO has already launched several projects and
              products, including:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Emerald Academy</strong> - A series of educational
              resources/bootcamps to onboard people into the Flow ecosystem and
              teach people how to develop on Flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>FLOAT</strong> - The POAP equivalent for the Flow
              blockchain. FLOAT is a proof of participation system based on NFTs
              on the Flow blockchain. It allows event creators to reward and
              recognize their community members for participating in their
              events.

              <strong>Emerald bot</strong> - a Discord bot that provides Flow
              project/DAO owners to set up gated access to their Discord
              channels based on token holdings. You can think of this as the
              Collab.Land equivalent for Flow.

              Oni Ronin is a generative PFP (profile pic) NFT project from Big
              Head Club, the creators Stoner Cats. The project is based around
              the Japanese folklore of Ronin - masterless Samurai, who served no
              lord, and so had no honour.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to legend, when Ronin died, they would meet Oni on their
              path to the afterlife. The Oni attacked and consumed their souls,
              turning them into shells of their former selves - The Oni Ronin.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only escape: The Trial of Ascension. An Oni Ronin of legendary
              will may break free of the Oni possessing them. Some have summoned
              the strength to challenge their tormentor to a duel. But every
              single man or woman who has stood their ground, everyone who has
              fought an Oni has died. But where they have failed, you will
              succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Owning an Oni Ronin NFT comes with several benefits. These include
              commercial rights to do whatever you want with your Oni Ronin NFT,
              Big Head Club membership, Samurai history lessons, Haiku (death
              poem) writing workshops, meditation sessions, virtual tea
              ceremonies, flower arranging classes, and access to exclusive Oni
              Ronin merchandise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Big Head Club is also working on a manga-style comic book telling
              the story of Oni Ronin and the Trial of Ascension.
